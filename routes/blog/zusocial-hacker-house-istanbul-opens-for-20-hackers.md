This digital society isn't simply a blank slate awaiting design; it's a dynamic arena where individual rights and institutional powers constantly vie for dominance, swaying between centralization and decentralization. Every online interaction places us in the midst of this silent struggle.

Pioneers of the next-generation internet have laid significant groundwork: federated networks bridging diverse communities, peer-to-peer protocols ensuring individual autonomy, and blockchains maintaining incorruptible relationships. We've been active and will only intensify our efforts, driven by a shared conviction: "Public spaces" aren't self-evident domains; they're territories worth fighting for.

The reason the Internet remains unfinished might not be due to our technology being too primitive. On the contrary, it might be too advanced. Yet, for the individuals it connects, the "true social network" has not yet emerged. Designing a robust social network, much like building a thriving city, is complex. We have to rely on insights from many different disciplines, whether it is urban planning or community organizing.

That is why we need to bring together the finest minds in decentralized social, engage in profound discussions, and craft the way forward, and why contributors to  [Matters Lab](http://matters-lab.io), [Mask Network](https://mask.io/), and [Social Layer](https://app.sociallayer.im/) are organizing ZuSocial Hacker House.

This event will foster discussions, bringing together pioneers, practitioners, and researchers from diverse thought spectrums to share insights and challenge norms. Additionally, we are opening the doors to 20 resident hackers, providing complimentary housing and workspace to facilitate team formation and active participation in discussions and hackathons.

### ZuSocial Hacker House has four following tracks:

  1. **On-Chain Identity and Reputation.**

     How do we integrate the growing blockchain identity ecosystem into existing decentralized networks? Interested in designing the best solution for proof-of-humanhood?

  2. **Taking Web3 Social Networks to Users and Markets**

     In Web2, advertisement and subscription emerged as two major models, both with problems. With smart contracts, how do we redesign them, or invent alternatives?

  3. **Autonomous Social**

     What does the social landscape look like when AI copilots and LLMs level up our digital experience? Whatâ€™s the role of human creators when contents are mostly generated by AIs?

  4. **All About Social Graph**

     Social graphs can be stored in p2p networks, federated networks or blockchain networks. What are their most suitable use cases, and can we combine them together?

_Join us in Istanbul this November and be part of the change. Interested participants can apply at [https://hackerhouse.social/](https://hackerhouse.social/.)_
