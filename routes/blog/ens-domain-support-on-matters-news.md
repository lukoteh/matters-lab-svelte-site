Since January 2021, [Matters Lab](https://matters-lab.io)'s main product [Matters.News](https://matters.news) has officially supported Wallet Registration and Log In with MetaMask and WalletConnect. Within 6 months, more than 10% users connect their Matters.News account to ETH address for login or displaying the NFTs in the wallets as avatars.

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain, and is the largest domain name service on the blockchain. ENS allows users to create short letters human-readable names to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata.

Currently, when a user configures ENS and logs in to Matters.News with their wallet, their ENS domain name is displayed on the personal homepage. Each creator on using Matters.News has a static website stored on IPFS, now with one click they can set IPFS CID as contenthash field for ENS via the EIP-1577 standard. This means that over 100k content creators using Matters.News can use ENS as their personal domain, compatible with projects such as Planet, eth.limo, Brave.

By supporting ENS, Matters Lab hopes to strengthen our infrastructure and integration with the Web3 ecosystems. As Web3 applications become more widely known and accepted by the public, an improved and expanded service and user

experience is the inevitable path forward. Matters Lab will continue to build a truly decentralized social protocol for all creators.

### About ENS

Started at the Ethereum Foundation in early 2017, The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a naming service for wallet addresses, hashes, and other machine-readable identifiers that [runs on the Ethereum blockchain](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/why-ens-uses-ethereum-and-eth-not-a-bespoke-blockchain-and-token-36f86727e71f). Users can buy and manage their own ENS domains with ETH. ENS also supports use with other DNS domains, including .com and .org. ENS is currently the most widely integrated blockchain naming standard with over 2.17 million domains and over 540,000 users. ENS is currently governed by DAO and has a governance token, ENS.
