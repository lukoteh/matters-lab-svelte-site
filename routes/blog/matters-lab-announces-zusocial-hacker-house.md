![Matters Lab, Mask Network, and Social Layer Announce the Launch of ZuSocial Hacker House in Collaboration with Zuzalu](

*NEW YORK/TAIPEI/HONG KONG*, October 13th, 2023 –

> In a landmark collaboration, **Matters Lab** joins forces with **Mask Network** and **Social Layer** to present **[ZuSocial Hacker House](https://hackerhouse.social) in Istanbul, Turkey from November 5th to 19th**, an initiative of 14-day program in the decentralized social space. This hacker house serves as a vital part of [ZuConnect](https://zuzalu.city/), the popup village initiated by Zuzalu, as well as [DevConnect](https://devconnect.org/), bringing together Ethereum's most important builders, researchers, and its community, to amplify the bonds within the decentralized community and pushing the boundaries of digital connection.


### Integrating the Power of Decentralized Social Networks

With the influence of social networks ever-growing and traditionally under the control of a few, the push for genuine decentralization is intensifying. ZuSocial Hacker House aspires to bridge blockchain ventures with other key decentralized platforms, encouraging innovative minds to prioritize the human element over solely technological advances. Attendees can anticipate a fusion of a hacker house and mini-conference, exploring the intricacies of Ethereum and social networks through engaging hackathons, workshops, panel discussions, and grand demo day in a cooperative ambiance.

Earlier this year, [Matters Lab](https://matters-lab.io) participated in the popup city Zuzalu spearheaded by Vitalik. Following its success, Zuzalu is presenting ZuConnect as a popup village in November 2023 in Istanbul, aiming to reconnect people and lay the foundation for the next Zuzalu iteration.

ZuSocial Hacker House is seamlessly integrated as a part of ZuConnect. Acting as a catalyst, ZuSocial Hacker House will play pivotal roles in both the DeSocial track in ZuConnect and the Hack Zuzalu hackathon – a concentrated effort by the partner teams focusing on decentralized social solutions and amalgamating DWeb and Web3's best offerings.

Guo Liu, co-founder of Matters Lab emphasizes, "Our vision with ZuSocial is to bring together the finest minds in decentralized social, engage in profound discussions, and craft the way forward. By hosting panel discussions, we're not only featuring renowned personalities like Vitalik, while delving into pivotal decisions by large tech companies to embrace decentralization.”

He further adds, "ZuSocial is not just another event; it's a transformative experience – a synergy of blockchain and other decentralized systems, focusing on human experiences rather than mere tech.”


### The Future of Decentralized Social Networks

The Web3 era brings transformative advancements, turning past visions into today's realities. Designing a robust social network, much like building a thriving city, is complex. However, insights from urban planning and social community evolution can guide our digital journey. Decentralized social networks, emerging after DeFi, challenge centralized media's dominance. The question arises: Can these innovations evolve into more user-friendly networks?

To address these pressing queries, this hacker house will foster discussions, bringing together pioneers, practitioners, and researchers from diverse thought spectrums to share insights and challenge norms. Additionally, we are opening the doors to 20 resident developers, providing complimentary housing and workspace to facilitate team formation and active participation in discussions and hackathons. **Learn more at [hackerhouse.social](https://hackerhouse.social).**
