[Matters Lab](https://matters-lab.io) continues to build a better creator ecosystem, in which a complete choice of financial support methods lays the foundation. Matters Lab is delighted to achieve the milestone of launching [Tether (USDT)](https://tether.to/) deployed on [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) as one of the cryptocurrency Support methods in Q4 2022.

By integrating with Polygon and Tether (USDT), Matter Lab achieved an important milestone in on-chain content discovery and evaluation. We believe that the evaluation and distribution of content should be determined by each community. Supporting content through Matters smart contract is not only an appreciation of the value provided but also an on-chain discovery mechanism supported by various clients and services. The future community dynamic and economic model of Matters Lab will also base on it.

[Matters.Town](https://matters.town), the largest open-source decentralized publishing platform in the Web3 world, also the first entry of[ Matters Lab](https://matters-lab.io/), has supported donation with fiat currency HKD and cryptocurrency [LikeCoin](https://about.like.co/). Since Matters.Town was introduced in 2018, over one hundred thousand equivalent to USD of donation has been circulated on the platform. Matters creator ecosystem reinforces discoverability of contents with Support and donation functions. We turn creativity into monetary reward, forming a strong back community for creators, therefore connecting valuable content to the audiences.

In January 2022, Matters.Town opens ETH wallets registration, login and binding with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/). On top of that, Matters.Town now launches USDT payments, allowing users to directly transfer USDT on Polygon network to the wallets of the creators they appreciate. As long as both the supporter and rewarded author bind their account to ETH wallet, they will be able to pay with USDT Support through the Matters.Town.

Tether (USDT) is currently the largest stablecoin, and will be the first stablecoin Matters Lab support in our ecosystem. We look forward to providing Matters users with a more convenient and liquid Support solution by achieving the milestone.

Matters Lab will continue to collaborate with efficient application in the Web3 ecosystem. Polygon-USDT Support is just our beginning plan for integrating with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. We will support more ERC-20 standard tokens in the future to continue to optimize the creation and reading experience for our users.
